# Flutter Workshop

## Michael Bora Sanuk

### Before the Workshop

Things I recommend you do before the workshop:

- [Flutter in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHhRhPV--G0) — goes a little too fast but no need to understand/remember anything from here
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (you’ll need to install the Flutter & Dart extensions for either)
- [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (I won't be able to provide individual guidance in case something goes wrong, so it's better to install it beforehand)

### Day 1

1. What is Flutter, why is Flutter?
2. [Installing Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (brief intro, left as exercise)
3. What does developing with Flutter look like?
4. Dissecting the starter app (Counter)
   - Stateless/Stateful Widgets, Scaffold, Center, Text, Container, etc.
   - Project structure, package management, assets, fonts
1. Writing our first app: [Startup Name Generator](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)

**Exercise**: Create your own app!

### Day 2

2. Building a more advanced app
